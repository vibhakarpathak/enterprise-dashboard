# @enterprise/tokens

Design tokens and theme system for **EnterpriseOS**.

This package provides:
- Primitive design tokens (colors, spacing, radii, etc.)
- Semantic aliases for consistent meaning across themes
- Ready-to-use light and dark themes
- Utility to apply themes via CSS variables

Built with scalability in mind using an atomic-inspired structure.
